# Fibonacci with LangGraph: A Workflow Approach

## Traditional Fibonacci Implementation

```python
def fib(x):
    if ((x==0)|(x==1)):
        return x
    else:
        return fib(x-1)+fib(x-2)
```

The standard recursive approach calculates each number by repeatedly calling itself. This creates redundant calculations - F(5) recalculates F(3) twice and F(2) three times.

## LangGraph Workflow Implementation

The LangGraph version structures Fibonacci as a three-node workflow:

**Initialize Node**: Sets up F(0)=0, F(1)=1
**Calculate Node**: Generates next number using previous two values  
**Check Node**: Decides to continue or stop

```
Initialize → Calculate → Check → (Loop back OR End)
```

## Key Improvements

### Eliminates Redundancy
```python
# Traditional: F(5) makes 15 function calls
# LangGraph: F(5) makes 5 iterations
```

Each number calculated exactly once by maintaining state between nodes.

### Process Visibility
```
Calculate Node: F(2) = 1 + 0 = 1
Calculate Node: F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2  
Calculate Node: F(4) = 2 + 1 = 3
```

Every step is logged, showing exactly how each number is generated.

### Complete Series Storage
```python
series: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Entire sequence stored and accessible, not just individual numbers.

### Performance Impact
- **Traditional**: O(2^n) - exponential time  
- **LangGraph**: O(n) - linear time

F(40) goes from 300+ million calls to just 40 clean iterations.

The workflow transforms an expensive recursive problem into an efficient, transparent solution.
